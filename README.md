# Project-Nightingale
Over the past few decades, research in the NLP has been greatly facilitated by the availability and sharing of large annotated and well documented open source textual datasets such as those distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).
The availability of these datasets have led to the development of better translation systems for most global languages.  However, this is not the case for African languages. Currently, only 13 languages of the estimated 1500 local African languages in Africa are supported by Google translate. This is mainly due to the lack of reliable, well documented and insufficient annotated datasets on local African languages.
**Project Nightingale is an open source project  aimed at providing a platform for gathering, documenting and annotating textual data on local African languages.**
The project will move through three main phases:
..* A data curation phase (Phase I) where textual data will be collected and documented using a Data Standardization Template (DST).
..* The data quality phase (Phase II) involves performing parity and sanity checks on the data and corresponding documentation to ensure conformity to the DST.
..* Finally, all datasets that passed through the quality checks will be ingested to a cloud repository for public usage.
